Description: SigBridgeR is an integrative toolkit designed to identify phenotype-associated cell subpopulations by combining phenotype(e.g. survival, drug sensitivity), bulk expression and single-cell RNA-seq data. It leverages multiple algorithms (including 'Scissor', 'scPAS', 'scPP', and 'scAB') to robustly link cell features with clinical or functional phenotypes. The package provides a unified pipeline for cross-modal data analysis, enabling the discovery of biologically and clinically relevant cell states in heterogeneous  samples.
