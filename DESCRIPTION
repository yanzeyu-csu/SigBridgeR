Description: SigBridgeR is an integrative toolkit designed to identify tumor phenotype-associated cell subpopulations by combining mutational signatures (as phenotype), bulk expression and single-cell RNA-seq data, and . It leverages multiple algorithms (including 'Scissor', 'scPAS', 'scPP', and 'scAB') to robustly link molecular features with clinical or functional phenotypes. The package provides a unified pipeline for cross-modal data analysis, enabling the discovery of biologically and clinically relevant cell states in heterogeneous tumor samples.
