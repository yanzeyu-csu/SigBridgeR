# DO NOT RUN THESE SCRIPTS

These Python scripts are not meant to be run directly. They are called through the R script of the DEGAS method, so these scripts appear to be just a part of a complete code. To elaborate further, p1-p4 are the individual components of the DEGAS method script arranged in a complete sequence. Here, only p1 and p3 are present. They need to be combined with p2 and p4 generated by the code in order to be usable (see `DEGAS::makeExec`).

These scripts are from [https://github.com/tsteelejohnson91/DEGAS/tree/master/inst/tools](https://github.com/tsteelejohnson91/DEGAS/tree/master/inst/tools), under the MIT license, copied at 2025/10/05.

SigBridgeR uses these scripts to run the DEGAS method, and in the future, it may consider optimizing these scripts to improve the performance of the DEGAS method.
