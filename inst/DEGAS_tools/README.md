# DO NOT RUN THESE SCRIPTS

These Python scripts are not meant to be run directly. They are called through the R script of the DEGAS method (DEGAS.toolsPath), so these scripts appear to be just a part of a complete code.

To elaborate further, p1-p4 are the individual components of the DEGAS method script arranged in a complete sequence. Here, only p1 and p3 are present. They need to be combined with p2 and p4 generated by the code in order to be usable (see `DEGAS::makeExec`).

These scripts are from <https://github.com/tsteelejohnson91/DEGAS/tree/master/inst/tools>, under the MIT license, copied at 2025/10/05.

The `dev` folder contains the original files used to generate these `p1`, `p3` files. Running `0-build_scripts.py` will produce these files. SigBridgeR uses these scripts to run the DEGAS method, and in the future, it may consider optimizing these scripts to improve the performance of the DEGAS method.

### model

| Model Type | SC Data | Patient Data | Key Features |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **BlankClassMTL** | No labels | Classification | Only patient classification, SC for domain adaptation |
| **BlankCoxMTL** | No labels | Survival (Cox) | Only patient survival, SC for domain adaptation |
| **ClassBlankMTL** | Classification | No labels | Only SC classification, patient for domain adaptation |
| **ClassClassMTL** | Classification | Classification | Both tasks, with autoencoder |
| **ClassCoxMTL** | Classification | Survival (Cox) | SC classification + patient survival, with autoencoder |
