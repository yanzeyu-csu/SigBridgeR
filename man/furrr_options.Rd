  ...,

\arguments{
\item{...}{These dots are reserved for future extensibility and must
be empty.}

\item{stdout}{A logical.
\itemize{
\item If \code{TRUE}, standard output of the underlying futures is relayed as soon
as possible.
\item If \code{FALSE}, output is silenced by sinking it to the null device.
}}

\item{conditions}{A character string of conditions classes to be relayed.
The default is to relay all conditions, including messages and warnings.
Errors are always relayed. To not relay any conditions (besides errors),
use \code{conditions = character()}. To selectively ignore specific classes,
use \code{conditions = structure("condition", exclude = "message")}.}

\item{globals}{A logical, a character vector, a named list, or \code{NULL} for
controlling how globals are handled. For details, see the
\verb{Global variables} section below.}

\item{packages}{A character vector, or \code{NULL}. If supplied, this specifies
packages that are guaranteed to be attached in the R environment where the
future is evaluated.}

\item{seed}{A logical, an integer of length \code{1} or \code{7}, a list of
\code{length(.x)} with pre-generated random seeds, or \code{NULL}. For details, see
the \verb{Reproducible random number generation (RNG)} section below.}

\item{scheduling}{A single integer, logical, or \code{Inf}. This argument
controls the average number of futures ("chunks") per worker.
\itemize{
\item If \code{0}, then a single future is used to process all elements of \code{.x}.
\item If \code{1} or \code{TRUE}, then one future per worker is used.
\item If \code{2}, then each worker will process two futures (provided there
are enough elements in \code{.x}).
\item If \code{Inf} or \code{FALSE}, then one future per element of \code{.x} is used.
}

This argument is only used if \code{chunk_size} is \code{NULL}.}

\item{chunk_size}{A single integer, \code{Inf}, or \code{NULL}. This argument
controls the average number of elements per future (\code{"chunk"}). If \code{Inf},
then all elements are processed in a single future. If \code{NULL}, then
\code{scheduling} is used instead to determine how \code{.x} is chunked.}

\item{prefix}{A single character string, or \code{NULL}. If a character string,
then each future is assigned a label as \code{{prefix}-{chunk-id}}. If \code{NULL},
no labels are used.}
