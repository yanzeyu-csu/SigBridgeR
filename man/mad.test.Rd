\title{outlier detection using Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)}
\usage{
mad.test(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector. Missing values (\code{NA}) are allowed and will be
excluded from calculations.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. Should missing values be removed? Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
An object of class "htest" containing:
\item{statistic}{The test statistic (MAD-based z-score of most extreme outlier)}
\item{parameter}{Named vector with: n, median, mad, threshold}
\item{p.value}{Approximate p-value based on outlier probability}
\item{method}{Description of the method used}
\item{data.name}{Name of the data vector}
\item{alternative}{Character string describing the alternative hypothesis}
\item{outlier.indices}{Indices of detected outliers (as additional element)}
}
\description{
This function identifies outliers in a numeric vector using Median Absolute
Deviation (MAD) method, with specialized handling for very small samples.
Returns results in htest format for consistency with statistical tests.
}
\details{
For samples with n > 5, uses standard MAD method with threshold of 3.
For very small samples (n <= 5), uses MAD with adjusted thresholds:
\itemize{
\item n = 3-4: threshold = 2.5
\item n = 5: threshold = 2.8
}

The test statistic is calculated as the maximum absolute deviation from median
divided by adjusted MAD.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic usage
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5, 3)
mad.test(x)

# Small sample
x3 <- c(1, 2, 10)
mad.test(x3)
}
