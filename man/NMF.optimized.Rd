\title{Non-negative Matrix Factorization from scAB}
\usage{
NMF.optimized(X, K, maxiter = 2000L, tol = 1e-05)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A non-negative numeric matrix (features x samples) to be factorized.
All elements must be non-negative.}

\item{K}{The rank of factorization, i.e., the number of components/latent
features to extract. Must be a positive integer smaller than
both dimensions of X.}

\item{maxiter}{The maximum number of iterations for the optimization algorithm.
Defaults to 2000.}

\item{tol}{The convergence tolerance for the loss function. The algorithm
stops when the absolute change in Euclidean distance between
consecutive iterations is less than this value. Defaults to 1e-5.}
}
\value{
A list containing the factorization results:
\itemize{
\item \code{W} - The basis matrix (features x K), representing the
learned features or components
\item \code{H} - The coefficient matrix (K x samples), representing the
weights or activations of components for each sample
\item \code{iter} - The number of iterations actually performed
\item \code{loss} - The final value of the objective function (squared
Euclidean distance)
}
}
\description{
An R implementation of classical non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).

This function is from scAB package, and it is not recommended to use it because the computational efficiency of the R language is not very high.
For more advanced NMF implementations, see:
\code{\link[NMF]{nmf}} from the NMF package, which is written in C++ and is much faster than this function.
