\title{Create or Use Python Environment with Required Packages}
\usage{
SetupPyEnv(env_type = c("conda", "venv"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{env_type}{Character string specifying the type of Python environment to
create or use. One of: `"conda"`, `"venv"`.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to specific environment methods.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing verification results for the environment setup,
including installation status of all required packages. Invisibly returns
the verification results.
}
\description{
Sets up a Python environment with specified packages for DEGAS screening methods.
This function can create new environments or reuse existing ones, supporting
both Conda and venv environment types. It ensures all required dependencies
are properly installed and verified.

Default method for unsupported environment types. Throws an informative error
with supported environment types.
}
\details{
This function provides a comprehensive solution for Python environment
management in R projects, particularly for machine learning workflows
requiring TensorFlow. Key features include:

- **Environment Creation**: Automatically creates new environments or reuses
  existing ones with the same name
- **Package Management**: Installs specified Python packages with version
  pinning support
- **Verification**: Validates environment setup and package installations
- **Flexible Methods**: Supports different backend methods for environment
  creation (reticulate vs system calls)

The function uses S3 method dispatch to handle different environment types,
allowing for extensible support of additional environment managers in the future.
