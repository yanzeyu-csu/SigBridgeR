\title{SigBridgeR: Multi-algorithm Integration of Phenotypic, scRNA-seq, and Bulk Data for Cell Screening}
\description{
SigBridgeR is an integrative toolkit designed to identify phenotype-associated cell subpopulations by combining phenotype(e.g. survival, drug sensitivity), bulk expression and single-cell RNA-seq data. It leverages multiple algorithms (including 'Scissor', 'scPAS', 'scPP', 'scAB' and 'DEGAS') to robustly link cell features with clinical or functional phenotypes. The package provides a unified pipeline for cross-modal data analysis, enabling the discovery of biologically and clinically relevant cell states in heterogeneous  samples.
}
\section{Main functions}{

The package includes multiple algorithms for integrative analysis of single-cell and bulk data to identify (see function \itemize{\item \code{\link{Screen}}}) phenotype-associated cell populations.
}

\section{Data requirements (their pre-processing is also provided in the package)}{

\itemize{
\item Single-cell RNA-seq data (Seurat object format)
\item Bulk expression data
\item Phenotype data (survival, drug sensitivity, etc.)
}
}
