## Introduction

With so many parameters in the screening methods, it’s often confusing
how to select the best ones for your data. This document provides some
tips for parameter tuning.

## Find Optimal Parameters for `Scissor`

To enable scissor to search an optimal `alpha`, just change
`alpha = <A value>` to `alpha = NULL`. In this case, alpha will iterate
from 0.005 to 0.9 until the selected cells fraction is over the `cutoff`
value. That is to say, Scissor will designate exactly the top (and
bottom) percentage of cells —- corresponding to the specified cutoff
value -— as positive cells.

    # * From
    # scissor_res <- Screen(
    #   matched_bulk = matched_bulk,
    #   sc_data = sc_dataset,
    #   phenotype = matched_phenotype_data,
    #   phenotype_class = "survival",
    #   screen_method = c("Scissor"),
    #   alpha = 0.05
    # )

    # * To
    scissor_res <- Screen(
      matched_bulk = matched_bulk,
      sc_data = sc_dataset,
      phenotype = matched_phenotype_data,
      phenotype_class = "survival",
      screen_method = c("Scissor"),
      alpha = NULL # <<< HERE
    )

## Find Optimal Parameters for `scAB`

scAB has two key parameters, `alpha` and `alpha_2`: the former
determines the overall selection proportion, while the latter determines
the selection proportion within each scAB subset. Simply change the
values of these two parameters from single values to numeric sequences,
and scAB will automatically iterate through the combinations to find the
optimal pair of `alpha` and `alpha_2`.

    # * From
    # scAB_res <- Screen(
    #   matched_bulk = matched_bulk,
    #   sc_data = sc_dataset,
    #   phenotype = matched_phenotype_data,
    #   phenotype_class = "survival",
    #   screen_method = c("scAB"),
    #   alpha = 0.05,
    #   alpha_2 = 0.05
    # )

    # * To
    seq1 <- c(0.005, 0.01, 0.05)
    seq2 <- c(5e-7, 1e-6, 5e-6, 1e-5)

    scAB_res <- Screen(
      matched_bulk = matched_bulk,
      sc_data = sc_dataset,
      phenotype = matched_phenotype_data,
      phenotype_class = "survival",
      screen_method = c("scAB"),
      alpha = seq1, # <<< HERE
      alpha_2 = seq2 # <<< HERE
    )

    length(seq1) * length(seq2)
    # [1] 12

As you can see, with so many (alpha, alpha\_2) pairs – each requiring
evaluation -— the runtime can become prohibitively long. In such cases,
parallel computing can be employed to accelerate the process.

    # * install `furrr` & `future.mirai` first, as it is required for parallel computing
    # * We recommend using `future.mirai`, as it is more stable and faster than `future`
    rlang::check_installed(c("furrr", "future.mirai"))

    future::plan(future.mirai::mirai_multisession)

    scAB_res <- Screen(
      matched_bulk = matched_bulk,
      sc_data = sc_dataset,
      phenotype = matched_phenotype_data,
      phenotype_class = "survival",
      screen_method = c("scAB"),
      alpha = seq1,
      alpha_2 = seq2
      # parallel = TRUE # Auto-enabled
    )

After identifying the optimal (alpha, alpha\_2) pair, scAB will use this
parameter pair to perform the final cell screening.

## Find Optimal Parameters for `scPAS`

The iteration of alpha in scPAS is similar to that in Scissor, and the
method to enable iteration is the same.

    # * From
    # scPAS_res <- Screen(
    #   matched_bulk = matched_bulk,
    #   sc_data = sc_dataset,
    #   phenotype = matched_phenotype_data,
    #   phenotype_class = "survival",
    #   screen_method = c("scPAS"),
    #   alpha = 0.05
    # )

    # * To
    scPAS_res <- Screen(
      matched_bulk = matched_bulk,
      sc_data = sc_dataset,
      phenotype = matched_phenotype_data,
      phenotype_class = "survival",
      screen_method = c("scPAS"),

## Find Optimal Parameters for `scPP`

scPP is based on marker genes, AUC, and enrichment scores, which
requires tuning the `probs` parameter, as it represents the quantile
threshold. The input `probs` must be between 0 and 0.5.

    # * From
    # scPP_res <- Screen(
    #   matched_bulk = matched_bulk,
    #   sc_data = sc_dataset,
    #   phenotype = matched_phenotype_data,
    #   phenotype_class = "survival",
    #   screen_method = c("scPP"),
    #   probs = 0.2
    # )

    # * To
    # * Note that since a future strategy was previously enabled, parallel computation will also be used here

      matched_bulk = matched_bulk,
      sc_data = sc_dataset,
      phenotype = matched_phenotype_data,

      screen_method = c("scPP"),
      probs = NULL # <<< HERE
